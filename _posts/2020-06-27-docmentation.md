I got tired of being assaulted by social media apps. Facebook, Twitter, Instragram and most of these companies don't really care about you or community development. It's all about selling ads and stealing your attention. It's time to take back control. You can still reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulymarins/) or send an email to ulysses@hey.com.

I recently changed my email provider, from Google to [Hey](https://hey.com/). Same thing with my browser, from Chrome to [Brave](https://brave.com/). As soon as I go to Brazil and teach my family to use Telegram instead of Whatsapp, another revolution will start. Until there, I'll keep being a little bit hypocrite.

And no, I'm not using Google Analytics to analyze the metrics of this web site, I'm using this wonderful and [plausible](https://plausible.io/) tool.

Are you tired of Google too? Check [this list](https://restoreprivacy.com/google-alternatives/) with other alternatives for all their products.

We always have the option to do better, to be closer to our principles, but of course, it requires effort like all the good things in life. 

I invite you to join the revolution too.
