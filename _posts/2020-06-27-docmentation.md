I got tired of being assaulted by social media companies. Facebook, Twitter, and most of these companies don't really care about you or community development, it's all about selling ads and stealing your attention. It's time to take the control back.

You can still reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulymarins/) or send an email to ulysses@hey.com.

I recentely changed my email provider, from Google to [Hey](https://hey.com/). Same thing with my browser, from Chrome to [Brave](https://brave.com/).

As soon as I go to Brazil and teach my family to use Telegram instead of Whatsapp, another revolution will start. Until there, I'll keep being a little bit hypocrite ;)
